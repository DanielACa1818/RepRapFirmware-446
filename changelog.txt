/BuildRelease.sh:
    - line 16: Changed SBC to WIFI

/CoreN2G:
    /src
        /syscalls.cpp:
            - Commented out CoreAllocCCMRamPermanent calls (no ccmram.cpp)
        /STM32
            /ccmram.cpp:
                - Removed all ccmram (no ccmramend defined in linker script)
            /variants/STM32F446/ (Added Folder):
                /ldscript.ld:
                    - linker script from BTT release
                /variant.h:
                    - replaced stm32f407 with stm32f466 pins
                /variant.cpp (Copied from stm32f407 and BTT clock speeds used... I struggle with cubemx):
                    - PeriphClkInitStruct
                    - PLLM and PLLN values changed to 6 and 180 respectively 
                    - PLLSAI clock info added 
            /makefiles/STM32F4
                /makefile
                    - linker script changed to that of STM32F446
                    - stm32f40 flags changed to stm32f446
                    - removed hwserial 4 flag (boot loop when on)
                /Core
                    -Moved/replaced stm32f407 flag directory to stm32f446
                /RepRapFirmware
                    - removed BOSSA flag

/RepRapFirmware/src
    /targets/STM32
        /boards:
            - All Files but BIQU_SKR.h removed
            /BIQU_SKR.h:
                - All pins but octopus removed
        /Pins_STM32.cpp:
            - All LPC_Boards arrays removed
            - Generic pintable changed to octopus pin table
        /Pins_stm32.h:
            - Disabled multiple functions to save space (Async moves, dht sensor, track object names, paneldue support)
            - Disabled multiple kinematics to save space (polar, hangprinter, both scaras, both delta)
            - Removed STM32H directive in WIFI
            - Disabled 12864 LCD in ESP8266 WiFi
        /platform/tasks
            - Commented out CoreAllocCCMRamUsage

        /NVMEmulations.cpp:
            - Had to remove functions (replaced with bool entirely) -> May attempt to remove cnc related functions to fit               this in
